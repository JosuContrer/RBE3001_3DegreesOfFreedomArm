The 3 Degree of Freedom Robotic Arm provided by the third course of the Unified Robotics series offered at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Robotic manipulators are found today in industry, space, humanoids, operating rooms, and space. Their relevance in industry and diverse applications is crucial since they automate processes. Therefore, through calibration, testing, and calculations (forward and inverse kinematics) our team was able to move the robotic arm effectively in joint and task space.
